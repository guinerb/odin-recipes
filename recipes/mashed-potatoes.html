<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Mashed Potato Recipe is easy to make with basic ingredients like butter and sour cream with optional additions such as garlic and Parmesan cheese!</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3.5 lbs. Yukon Gold potatoes*, about 4 large potatoes, each about .85 lbs</li>
    <li>3.5 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste at the end</li>
    <li>6 Tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1 cup half & half</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add the half and half and sour cream to a small bowl and whisk to combine. Set it aside and allow it to come to room temperature. It shouldn't be cold when added to the potatoes.</li>
    <li>Peel each potato and give them a quick rinse to remove any dirt/residue from the peel. Cut into 3/4-inch slices and place in a large pot. Add cold water until they're all submerged.</li>
    <li>Slowly bring to a gentle boil, do not boil rapidly. This ensures the potatoes cook evenly and prevents them from falling apart. Once a soft boil is reached, add 3.5 teaspoons salt.</li>
    <li>Cook for 25 minutes or until the potatoes are very fork tender, don't undercook or they'll be lumpy when mashed. Turn heat off.</li>
    <li>Drain all of the water. Let the potatoes sit in the warm pot for 5 minutes to allow most of the steam to escape.</li>
    <li>Add the butter to the potatoes and allow it to gradually melt.</li>
    <li>Drizzle ¾ of the half & half/sour cream over the mashed potatoes. Mash with a potato masher (not an elective mixer), until soft and creamy. Don’t over mash or the consistency will become gluey. Add remaining dairy only if a slightly creamier texture is desired.</li>
    <li>Taste the potatoes and add more salt/pepper if needed. Transfer to a serving dish and serve!</li>
